At Metadot, we believe in the importance of teamwork and emotional development. We don’t want to create individuals who are just skilled in one area - we want  to create well-rounded, emotionally, physically, mentally and intellectually intelligent people. People who are self-aware, and strong communicators. This is where we introduced the Coffee Dates exercise. The prompts are not easy, small-talk questions, they are thought-provoking and make the individual self reflect. When you have a better understanding of yourself, you are better able to articulate your thoughts and become a more well-rounded human. When you are exposed to a more thorough side of another teammate, you have a better understanding of how they operate, and this helps everyone become a better support system when tackling challenges.

## Goals

Get to know your Colleagues better and build team relationships

Think critically, and self-reflect with the help of the thought provoking questions to better understand yourself, your beliefs, your goals and your experiences
