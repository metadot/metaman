At Metadot, completing tasks is much more than crossing off a check-list and calling it finished.
Creating high quality products requires high quality work ethic and evaluation. Here is how we ensure
that we are producing top-notch products and utilizing our resources to their fullest potential.

## How we define “DONE”

It is a big deal, that is why we use all capital letters for emphasis.
Being done means covering all of the bases, and ensuring that the work completed has been reviewed
extensively with no errors. Marking DONE next to a completed task demonstrates that the work is
something the creator is proud of, and utilized all resources to make sure it is top-quality.

## Quality Reviews

One way to guarantee quality is to have the work evaluated by someone other than the creator.
This is an individual who works in a similar field, or the same field, and is able to give credible
feedback on the work. Having an extra set of eyes review a product helps to catch errors or bugs that
may have been previously overlooked. Before the individual can begin working on the task, there needs
to be a designated quality reviewer. Once completed, the creator will share their work with the reviewer.
The reviewer will leave feedback on the work within 24 hours, as well as suggestions for improvement.
The reviewer will assign a quality score between 0-5, and communicate their review by leaving the
score next to the assigned task in the Sprint spreadsheet.

## Score Values

The numerical values are indicators of how well the task was completed, how it looks, and how it operates.
If the task receives a score between 0-3, it does not fit the quality standards, and the creator needs
to make some improvements. If the tasks receives a 4 or 5, it has passed the review and is able to move
forward or deploy. Scoring a 5 means that the task was near perfect, and of Apple level quality. 5’s are
extremely rare, and require above and beyond design. The reviewer is responsible for providing constructive
feedback that will improve the quality of the task. If a task has received a 4 or 5, it can be
considered “DONE” and marked as “DONE” in the Sprint spreadsheet.
