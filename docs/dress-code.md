# Metaman - Dress Code

Metadot is an entirely remote workplace, but still aims to create a unique and fun approach to work attire. 
Another goal was to break down the “Groundhog Day” effect that typically starts to happen in a remote 
environment when people are not leaving their homes daily to attend a physical workplace. At Metadot we
have specific days of the week that have known themes and expectations, while still allowing the
freedom to dress comfortably and appropriately in the remote setting. 

## Monday 

### The “Green Delivery”

Each member of the team wears the color green in the morning meeting to symbolize the completed tasks on the
“Sprint” spreadsheet Green indicates the progress the individual has made completing tasks from the week prior.

- Green = Completely finished and quality checked all tasks = `DONE`. This is the beginning of the week, so Metadot
aims to keep Monday’s exciting and celebrated, a way we do this is through our Green dress code 

- The green dress code allows for employees to be creative with how they choose to wear the green, and show individuality. While
also building team spirit as everyone is collectively participating in the system

## Tuesday - Thursday

The clothing choice for these days is simply up to the individual but has basic expectations for appropriateness 
Looking Presentable

- Hair brushed, t-shirts, pollos, casual button-ups, etc.
No holes in shirt, bare shoulders or pajama tops
It is encouraged to wear appropriate clothing on the bottoms, even though this part of the outfit may not be visible 
This simple dress code requires that people are still maintaining self-care in times of remote work, and are keeping up with basic hygiene: showering, brushing teeth, doing laundry, etc.

## Friday 

### Elegant Friday 

- Each member of the team dresses in formal attire. Men are expected to wear button-ups and ties. Women are expected to either wear a dress, pant-suit or button-up blouse
Opposite of the traditional workplace’s “Casual Friday”
A strong way to close out the week of hard work
A fun activity that employees can look forward to, and an excuse to get ready for something which is rare in times of quarantine

## Special Occasions
Formal attire if an individual is attending an event or virtual meeting with someone outside of the company, in a professional setting
Even though we are remote, we want to demonstrate our professionalism regardless of the setting
