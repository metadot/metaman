The research from the Empirical Software Engineer team asked 1,926 experts the top attributes that make a successful engineer and the results found: attention to detail, the continuous drive to improve, and honesty to be highly valued. At Metadot, we have found ways that these attributes are applicable far beyond just engineering, and strive to implement and develop these skills throughout our organization. Here are the ways that these attributes are valuable, and how we apply them.

## Attention to Detail

- Being able to understand and balance a variety of complex systems and ideas, with minimal to no mistakes.

- Possessing a thorough understanding of how each process works, and knowing how and where to detect potential errors.

- Having a strong attention to detail to proactively recognize errors that could occur in the future, which creates efficiency.

- Ex: Attention to detail for an engineer could be accurately writing code.

- Ex: Attention to detail for someone in another role such as administrative, could mean properly executing important documents and paperwork.

## Determined to Improve

- The individual should seek to never stop improving: oneself, the product, the quality, and the company.

- Openly seeking and educating oneself on industry trends and new ways and research that may be more impactful.

- This requires the individual being open-minded to new ideas and new methodologies, and accepting ideas/suggestions from other credible sources.

- Possessing an understanding that the industry is always changing, and the traditional route may not be the most effective or efficient.

## Honesty

- Honesty goes beyond just the work environment, but in the character of the individual and what they produce.

- Honesty requires a level of self-awareness and accountability.

- Honest people openly communicate when they have made an error, take responsibility, and share with others how they resolved this issue to create a more productive future for not just themselves but the company.

- They are open to hearing suggestions, and asking for help when there is an issue that they are struggling to resolve on their own.

If an individual does not possess all of these traits, or is stronger in other areas - this does not mean they will not be successful in their role. However, research shows that these are highly valued and effective characteristics that have proven to be beneficial. It is important to note that perfection is not obtainable, and is not the goal. The goal is to create well-rounded individuals, who are actively working to better themselves and the organization.
