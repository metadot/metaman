At Metadot, we have created an acronym that takes into account the key qualities that make a successful remote leader: R.E.M.O.T.E

## R - REWARDS

- Equipment. You will no longer be responsible for costly renter fees, this influx of money can be used to purchase needed equipment for your workers such as: desks, chairs, laptops and monitors.

- Praise. It is essential to not only praise a team member or department when they excel, but to make sure it is public. You can give praise verbally in a meeting, or write a note on the community board to give appreciation and recognition.

## E - EVALUATION

- Ask. Ask important questions about the structure of your company in a remote environment. What is our long term goal? What are our short term goals? What strategies have I implemented to help us reach these ambitions? Are the roles of my team (and company) able to be done remotely with the tools we have in place? What resources will they need to complete their tasks?

- Surveys. Give opportunity for open and honest feedback. Not just on the process, but how the individual feels about the process, and what can be improved. This gives insight to the company's wellbeing. This is not a one time situation, make sure to repeat these surveys at least once every three months to track progress.

- Data. Once you receive feedback, analyze and determine common trends. What is working? What is not working? This gives you insight to how to strategize and implement new systems.

## M - MINDSET

- “All In.” The leader has to be ready to fully commit themselves to the success of the team and the company. Especially during times of stress, people will turn to the leader to see how they are responding. Leadership needs to stay confident, dedicated and transparent. Believe in the talent of your company.

- Less Monitoring. Do not micromanage or over-monitor employees. This environment is built more on trust and progression, over forcing results. Giving your employees more free range to complete their tasks and work independently creates more impressive results.

- “Sprint.” This is a spreadsheet system we utilize to communicate our progress throughout the week. It is color coded to indicate where we are at in our process, and to ensure we are focused on our personal and team goals.

## O - ORGANIZATION

- Documentation. Develop a handbook, which is a written document that holds core values, policies, structures and other important information. It is a document that is shared with all employees, and is updated when necessary. It is essential that the handbook is accessible and referenceable at all times. The blueprint for a successful remote company is in the accuracy and specificity of the handbook

- Buddy System. This is especially important for the remote onboarding process. Each new employee is paired with a veteran employee who is responsible for answering questions and being a guiding resource throughout the process.

- Accessibility. Ensuring each department has access to information, platforms of communication and softwares that allow them to successfully complete their work remotely. At Metadot, we use Discord. It has different “Channels” and “Rooms” which act as spaces where we can hold audio and video meetings, as well as work together, and share information.

## T - TRANSPARENCY

- Communication. Leadership that is open and honest about company policies and changes. This does not mean revealing all company secrets, but instead providing context and information to employees about the state of the company and goals.

- Leading by Example. Don’t just talk about what your values are, be about them. Demonstrate them. For example, if you are encouraging members of your team to take time off for a nice break, make sure you take time off as well. Be clear and honest that you are taking a vacation, this gives an extra sign of approval for those who are more hesitant.

- Vulnerability. Be open about when you are wrong, admit your mistakes. Share about times you have failed and how you improved for the future to ensure success.

## E - EMPATHY

- Burnout. Be aware of burnout, and know how to spot the signs. Talk openly about this issue, when you address things head on, people are more likely to take steps to avoid these problems.

- 1 on 1’s. Have these meetings with each member of your team. Learn about their interests, goals, family life, etc. When you build this relationship it is an investment into your employee and company. People will feel heard and respected, and decrease the chance of burnout. Plus, socialization is a key factor in eliminating stress.

- Invest. Make a plan with HR and Finance teams that give resources for your employees to invest in their mental and physical health. This can be sponsoring gym memberships, or putting funds towards counseling for those who are interested.

- Events. Plan events that are not work related. Events that are no-pressure and allow the team to engage with one another and form bonds. Not every moment has to be focused and working, having a playful release from the work day can give a nice break and more energy for when returning to tasks.

- Understand. If you are recognizing someone is showing signs of burnout, do not be angry. Do not call them out publicly, or put extra pressure on the individual. Instead schedule a meeting or 1 on 1 and see how you can help assist the situation, and ease the stress of the individual.
