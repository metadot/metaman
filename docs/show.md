# Show & Tell 

Metadot has a weekly activity called “Show & Tell” where members of the team are encouraged to share an object or skill that holds value to them.
This activity is done with the intention to build team relationships, encourage self-reflection, improve communication skills, and relieve the stress of burnout.

## How we do it
- Each week, one member from the team will volunteer to show something they created, found, inherited, or learned
- With each person’s camera on and the speaker’s microphone on during the presentation. The volunteer presenter
will take 10 minutes to show their object or skill 
- Answer questions about their methods and why is it important to the individual
- Answer further questions from the team about their presentation
- Take a photo of the object shared for future blog posts and the website 

## Who participates
- Members of the Metadot/MojoHelpdesk software team
- The volunteer of the week
- The volunteer signs up on Monday, after the Green Delivery meeting

## What is shared
- Something the individual has found, created, inherited, or learned
- An object or skill that is presentable 
- It can be funny, interesting, informational, historical, etc.

## When

- At 11:30 AM (CST) and 6:30 PM (CET)

## Where
